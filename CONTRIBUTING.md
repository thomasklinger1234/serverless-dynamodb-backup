# How to contribute

## Code contributions

If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

### Submitting your changes

Once your changes are ready to submit for review:

1. Test your changes
2. Rebase your changes
   Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main repo, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your initial changes to be squashed into a single commit. Later, if we ask you to make changes, add them as separate commits. This makes them easier to review. As a final step before merging we will either ask you to squash all commits yourself or we'll do it for you.
3. Submit a pull request
    In the pull request, choose a title which sums up the changes that you have made, and in the body provide more details about what your changes do. Also mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken place, eg "Closes #123".
4. Be patient
    We might not be able to review your code as fast as we would like to, but we'll do our best to dedicate it the attention it deserves. Your effort is much appreciated!
